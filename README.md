Java Grinder Playstation 2 demo.
================================

Introduction
------------

Since Java Grinder is getting Playstation 2 support, I decided
to open a new repository for the demo.  Previously we've been
putting the demos in the samples directory of Java Grinder but
I since this one might have some bigger assets I wanted a
separate repository for it.  There is still a small sample
program with Java grinder, but it show off as much as this one
should.

Joining The Project
-------------------

I plan on inviting friends to help me write this demo... anyone
who would like to join this project please send me an email before
starting.

To join, 3 things are required:

* This repository
* Java Grinder
* naken_asm

```
git clone https://github.com/mikeakohn/playstation2_demo.git
git clone https://github.com/mikeakohn/java_grinder.git
git clone https://github.com/mikeakohn/naken_asm.git
```

To make the process easier, put all 3 of these repositories in the
same directory.  The Makefile in the demo will find java_grinder and
naken_asm by prefixing the executable with ../

As far as coding style, please keep the coding style as close to the
rest of the program as possible.  No tabs and no Egyptian brackets.
There are examples lower in this file.
